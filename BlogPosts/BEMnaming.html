    <article class="content__text-regular">
      <p class="has-dropcap">BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier and it is a naming convention for writing
        cleaner and more readable CSS classes. It provides three specific benefits; it communicates purpose or function,
        communicates component structure, and sets a consistent low-level of specificity for styling selectors. Because
        of this it always has the same name in all technologies so it is consistent and meaningful enough that it is as
        informative as possible for a developer.</p>
      <p>The first part of the name is “Block” and they are independent, reusable, and usually bigger components of a
        webpage. They encapsulate a standalone entity that is meaningful on it’s own, they can also have modifiers and
        contain elements. These could be things like &#x0003C;header>, &#x0003C;nav>, &#x0003C;section>, &#x0003C;form>,
        &#x0003C;article>, &#x0003C;footer> the most common blocks on every website today are header, content, sidebar,
        footer, and search. Blocks in BEM are always a starting point of chaining your CSS classes onto. Take a look at
        a few block examples: a content, a menu, a search form </p>
      <p>.content{}</p>
      <p>.menu{}</p>
      <p>.search{}</p>
      <p>A block is usually a single word but if you have longer block definition then it is divided with a single
        hyphen:.lang-switcher{}</p>
      <p>The next part is going to be the “Elements” part, and they are the children of blocks that perform a particular
        function. An element can only have one parent block, and it can’t be used independently outside of that block.
        Element names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. The naming of an element must start
        with its parent block name, two underscores after it, and then its own name and it should only make sense in the
        context of its block: a content article, a menu item, a search input field</p>
      <p>.content__article{}</p>
      <p>.menu__item{}</p>
      <p>.search__input{}</p>
      <p>The last part of the BEM naming structure is the “Modifier” which represents different states or styles of
        classes and it is how we represent the variations of a block. Such as a button size, which are size variations
        of the button itself. Modifiers can be used for both blocks or elements and they are used to change appearance,
        behavior or state. CSS class is formed as a block’s or element’s name plus two dashes: </p>
      <p>.block--mod or .block__elem--mod and .block--color-red. </p>
      <p>Spaces in complicated modifiers are replaced with a dash. In HTML a modifier must be used together with its
        block/element as additional features:</p>
      <p>.form--large {} // Block modifiers</p>
      <p>.form--small {}</p>
      <p>.form__button--red {} // Block Element Modifiers</p>
      <p>.form__button--green {}</p>
      <p>Using the examples from before a modifier might look like a: content featured article, menu link, search field
        with or without an icon</p>
      <p>.content__article--featured{}</p>
      <p>.menu__item--link{}</p>
      <p>.search__input--icon{}</p>
      <p>The modifier name can also start with a single underscore: .lang-switcher__flag_basic{}.
        The one vital rule in BEM methodology is that a modifier cannot be used outside of the context of its owner.
