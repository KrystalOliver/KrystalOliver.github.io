    <article class="content__text-regular">
      <p class="has-dropcap">There are three main ways to size elements when coding in CSS; px, em, and rem’s.
        Originally there were only pixels (px) for sizing things so people became comfortable with using them
        exclusively to code their design with. Over the years technology changed rapidly and from that came the need to
        have more flexible sizing as pixels did not measure up to the accessibility needs of current web design. Browser
        vendors have added in more features to allow designers to create flexible and robust designs such as browser
        zooming. Browser zooming is when the user zooms the page and everything should scale up or down depending on the
        user preference. </p>
      <p>Zooming is just one important part of being accessible to people in today’s world and it is the main reason
        that designers switched over to responsive and unitless values for CSS. Users need to be able to zoom the
        viewport without loss of content, functionality, or restrictions imposed by CSS values or viewport scaling
        settings. Another feature of most browsers is the option to adjust your preferred font size which operates
        independently from the page zoom feature. When changing the browser’s default font-size all fonts should scale
        up (or down) proportionately in reference to the size of that setting, that is if there are relative CSS units
        being used. </p>
      <p class="content__text-medium">Pixels</p>
      <p>Pixels are the old reliable, they are quickly translatable and it is easy to take sizes directly from Photoshop
        straight to build for people who work with artists. Pixels used to be the only form of sizing so many people are
        just using them because it is what they always used and it’s worked so far. Pixels are an absolute unit of
        measurement, meaning that they are the same size regardless of anything else, although they are not consistent
        as 16px on a laptop is not the same as 16px on a phone.
      </p>
      <p>The biggest problem of using pixels is that they are inaccessible because of their being absolute. If a user
        sets their default font size in their browser then the font-sizes of individual sites should change accordingly.
        If the sizes of fonts in the site were set using pixels they will not change to the user's new default
        font-size. This makes the site much more difficult to navigate and understand for people who rely on the ability
        to zoom and change font sizes. The users can still zoom in so it doesn’t completely ruin accessibility but
        pixels are nonetheless not ideal from an accessibility and flexibility standpoint. </p>
      <p class="content__text-medium">Ems</p>
      <p>Ems are a relative measure of length that is based on the computed value of the font size of the parent
        element. This means that the child elements are always dependent on their parent to set their font size in code.
        That means that if you have a
      </p><div> with the font size set to 16px, and a <p> element inside that
        </p><div> with a font-size set to 2em, the font size of the text in the <p> will be 32px. If it is set to .5px, then
            the font size will be 8px. This gives the user the freedom to adjust their default browser font size, while
            still maintaining the relative scale of each element that is specified.</p>
          <p>1em = 16px (1 * 16)</p>
          <p>2em = 32px (2 * 16)</p>
          <p>.5em = 8px (.5 * 16)</p>
          <p>Em’s are better for responsive design because you can set breakpoints for device screens with media
            queries, change the measurements for elements at different breakpoints and have all the em-measured elements
            resize automatically. Because of this, em's are particularly good at being used in media queries. </p>
          <p>Em’s are responsive and relatively easy to use until there is a lot of nested code inside of classes.
            Because all of the em’s sizings are being directly based off of their parent size, it can become
            unmanageable when you have multiple things nested. This means that nested elements that use EM for sizing
            can sometimes end up being a size that you didn’t anticipate. On the other hand, it does give you more
            fine-grained control if you need it to specify the size for a particular area of a page. That is why Rem’s
            were created as a solution to the issue presented with em’s. </p>
          <p class="content__text-medium">Rem's - root em's</p>
          <p>Rem’s are another relative measure of length. They are a way of setting sizes based on the size of the root
            HTML element; they also allow for the quick scaling of an entire project by changing the root font-size.
            They are essentially responsive sizing but instead of being dependent on a parent element like em’s they are
            dependent on the root font-size. </p>
          <p>Html font size is set to 10px, paragraph is set to 1.6rem</p>
          <p>1.6rem*10px=16px</p>
          <p>It is essentially the same as em’s.</p>
          <p>1rem = 16px</p>
          <p>2rem = 32px</p>
          <p>.5rem = 8px</p>
          <p>It doesn't matter how deeply nested an element is, its rem length will always be a proportion of the font
            size of <html>. These are good for sizing and spacing especially.
