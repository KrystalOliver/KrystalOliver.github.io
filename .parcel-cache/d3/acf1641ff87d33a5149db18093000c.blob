    <article class="content__text-regular">
      <p class="has-dropcap">Forms are used so often that you would be hard pressed to find anyone who hasn’t
        at least filled out one in their lifetime. They take many shapes and sizes, from job and apartment
        applications where it is basic information easily filled out to study and review forms where there
        might be more comment sections. Most people want to fill out the form as fast as they can and forget
        about it, not thinking about the process or time someone took creating the form. That’s how it
        should be, if the form is designed well then it should be thoughtless for the user to navigate
        through. Forms tend to be bland and dry by nature but there are some important key elements that
        make up a well designed form that need some thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why bother designing a good form? It’s already a dry subject and people don’t stay on the form long
        enough for them to really appreciate the effort a designer puts into it. Spending time to create a
        well designed form is going to be better in the long run for everyone because designers will have
        more people filling them out and the users will have the best experience. A form can be designed to
        make the user slow down and think about what is being told to them or it can have them quickly
        finish with the least amount of struggle simply by the placement of the labels. A good design can
        make all the difference in the user experience.
        Part of creating a well designed form is having it be user-friendly and making sure the user has a
        good experience while filling out the form. A user-friendly form is easy to understand, and complete
        so it should have things that make the form easier for the user to get the most from the experience.
        The user should be able to scan through the form and understand what they need to do by using the
        placement of labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The top aligned labels are the quickest way for a user to scan through a form if there is nothing
        important that is needed of them, this is best for forms that require only basic stuff like job or
        apartment applications because there is no new information needed for them, they always require
        background info and there is rarely anything different from form to form so it can be completed
        quickly. The right aligned labels are a little slower to complete than the top aligned but it is
        still pretty quick and it requires less vertical space. That means that it is good for forms where
        there is going to be a lot of vertical space needed because of the amount of input boxes or
        information required. A form shouldn’t seem too long or complex or it might overwhelm the user and
        make it harder to complete so if there is going to be a long form it should be broken into sections
        and make the most of the vertical space. The last label alignment, left-aligned, is the slowest of
        the three kinds and it is good for forms where the designer needs long labels or where they need the
        user to slow down and actually read what the form is saying. It is a way to force the user to slow
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        User’s also should type as little as possible in order to keep the form as easy to complete as
        possible so as they are filling out addresses there should be an autofill option. Some forms also
        know the location of the user so they can figure out what would be closest to them or give them
        different options for their location. Another good thing to do to maximize user-friendly design is
        to have formatting already in place for some things such as formatting a mask for how phone numbers
        will be put into the form. Masks format text automatically while the field is being filled out, so
        it will be able to notice errors easily. ( )___-____

      <p>
        Good design also requires accessibility, as not everyone uses the internet in the same way and many
        people require different tools in order to fill out a form or easily understand a website or design.
        Accessibility is designing for users that aren’t the “average” and then trying to make things easier
        for them to fill out the form. Many people just see accessibility as for the extreme cases and
        therefore quite rare but that isn’t quite the case. The elderly are a large group of technology
        users and they usually have visual and auditory challenges and quite frequently struggle with the
        new modern kinds of designs. Accessible design should be created so the most common user can have an
        easy time navigating it out but it needs to also take into consideration the users that have
        specific needs or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many different kinds of tools that help with accessibility. For people with motor control
        functions keyboard shortcuts are vital in order to navigate the design, for visually impared users
        they need to have large and easy to read fonts or the ability to have the form screen read, for
        people with focus problems they need limited clutter on a page, and for people who can have
        epileptic attacks they need to be careful of animations or videos. Accessibility is becoming
        something that is expected from all designs and from that need there are many more tools being
        created all the time, such as Accessibe, an accessibility tool used in order to scan a website and
        see if it is accessible to multiple kinds of users. It simultaneously is able to allow users to
        adjust the appearance and behavior of a site as well as utilizing AI to optimize a website for
        screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other accessible tools. There are many different needs of
        users, and it can be a little overwhelming to think about all the different needs of them but these
        things could mean the difference between someone being able to fill out a form, navigating a site or
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many different elements to a form, all of which can be used for different purposes and are
        a necessary part of the structure of a well good design;
      </p>
      <p><b class="content__text-medium">1. Text input - </b>Text input is for user input that is short, just one line
        of input, such as a
        name,
        phone number, or email. This is probably the most common element of a form.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="content__text-medium">2. Text area - </b>Text area is another text input field from the user but this
        one is a
        multi-line input
        where the user can press enter. This is good for when the designer doesn't necessarily know the
        length of the input, such as comments, and gives the user more flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="content__text-medium">3. Password Input - </b>Password input is a text input that is hidden from view,
        it is used for
        things that
        are private so no one can read over the user’s shoulder and see something that could be harmful to
        them. This is usually used for things such as Social security numbers and passwords. There should be
        a choice to unhide the input, in case the user needs to see what they wrote to check its
        correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="content__text-medium">4. Radio select - </b>A radio is the circle equivalent to a checkbox except that
        with a radio it
        can only
        be used once for a list of options, like multiple choice questions. This is for when there will be
        multiple options and a radio will choose only one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="content__text-medium">5. Checkbox - </b>A checkbox is essentially a true false statement in a user
        input form. There
        will be
        options that have a checkbox next to them and if they are true, then the user marks them, otherwise
        they are left blank. There can be multiple checkboxes marked at once. This can be used for when
        multiple options can be used at once, such as marking hobbies or favorite tv shows from a list.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="content__text-medium">6. Dropdown - </b>A dropdown menu is when there is a button that the user clicks
        on in order to
        drop down a
        list of items to see, the user can then choose one value from that list. It can be used to organize
        lists, options, or pages in a website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="content__text-medium">7. File input - </b>File input is essentially a button that allows the user to
        go into their
        computer’s
        files and choose something to upload to the form. This can be used to upload an image or a pdf such
        as a resume for a job application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="content__text-medium">8. Submit Button - </b>All of these elements would go to waste without the
        submit button, it is
        how all of
        the information entered is communicated with the designer. It is used on the bottom of all types of
        forms, such as applications or survey’s, and is usually in the shape of a large button.
