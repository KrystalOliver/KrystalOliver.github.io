      <p class="has-dropcap">Along with the rapid growth of technology came a whole new perspective of how
        society can function.
        Technology has solved many issues in the world and in turn created opportunities that were
        previously
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when something grows too fast it often becomes unstable, which is the case with
        many things related to technology. No app, website, or device was fully capable of handling the
        magnitude of what could happen if they suddenly had a huge influx of users. The thought of how
        people
        could use technology in ways other than originally intended wasn’t one that most designers thought
        too
        far into at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example facebook has about 2.80 billion monthly active users and they
        were able to keep that number so high by making sure that their app was as interesting and addictive
        as
        possible regardless of the consequences. Facebook will spread fake news and damaging information
        like
        wildfire if it means that they will get more user interaction and people will spend more time on
        their
        app. They will have notifications popping up on people’s personal devices in order to keep users
        thinking about them all day and they will have shoddy privacy policies because they are more focused
        on
        making money then on actually protecting their users and creating a helpful environment. Now that
        they
        are on such a large scale any decision impacts a large number of users as even one percent of
        Facebook’s
        user base is still 28 million people so they have huge influence in modern society in a way they
        never
        could have imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designers are taught to create with empathy, being able to put themselves inside of their user’s
        perspective and trying to find all of the different ways their product will be used, valued, and
        abused.
        Over the years this has been sort of left behind and rushed for the sake of exponential growth,
        because
        of this a lot of problems have surfaced. Nightmare scenarios are bound to happen when a designer’s
        creation has so many users, things that were unthinkable before are now suddenly able to become
        fully
        wielded and used against others.
      </p>
      <p>That is the case of smart technology such as Wi-Fi, doors,
        speakers,
        thermostats, lights, and cameras which were all created for ease of use, for people who are going to
        be
        gone a lot or going on vacation and want to make sure their house is taken care of and safe. But all
        of
        these items are used in an increasing number of domestic violence cases as a way for the abuser to
        control the environment of their target. Smart technology is essentially erasing the distance
        between
        abusers and their victims, allowing for new kinds of torment and tracking at any time. Before smart
        technology this couldn’t have been possible because the abuser had to have some sort of access to
        their
        target for abuse to occur, whether that be emotional or physical.
      </p>
      <p> Domestic violence is all about control and smart technology gives a new layer of it, along with a
        sort
        of anonymity for the abuser. With the ability to have all smart technology installed inside of a
        home,
        abuse can easily happen if only one part of a couple has all of the passwords and access to the apps
        to
        turn everything on.
      </p>
      <p>Through an easy to use app someone can turn on a stereo at full volume, turn the
        thermostat up to 100 degrees, lock all the doors, access all cameras inside and outside the house,
        etc
        which creates a feeling of helplessness in the target and a sense of complete control in the abuser
        both
        of which they crave. Having cameras inside and outside of the house is also a way for the target to
        be monitored at all times and so the abuser can get real time visuals of their target reacting to the
        chaos caused. Many cameras are so small they can be almost indistinguishable and oftentimes victims can
        feel as if they are going crazy and they don’t know enough about the technology to understand exactly
        what is going on or how to fix it. Their only option becomes unplugging everything and dealing with the
        consequences such as their abuser becoming angry and furthering their isolation and lack of control.
      </p>
      <p>Along with the smart home technology there is another way that abuser’s keep control over the
        target’s that they live with or even those they have very little contact with such as ex’s or people they
        stalk and that is through apps that can be installed onto the victim’s phone. These apps can do multiple
        things such as tracking, monitoring texts, calls, emails, view photo’s and video’s stored on the
        phone, intercept calls and even record what the target is saying or seeing when not on a call through the
        phone’s microphone and camera.
      </p>
      <p>Many victims don’t even know that they are being tracked until they see their tormentor suddenly showing up everywhere they go, or when the abuser shows up with
        confidential photos to use as blackmail taken from the target’s own personal phone. The apps aren’t especially
        difficult to install, either, so there doesn’t have to be a skilled hacker putting it on the phone,
        the only thing that the tormentor needs is easily accessible consumer spyware and an opportunity to
        install it on their target’s device where it will be in stealth mode and undetectable by most individuals.
        In fact most spyware apps are developed and advertised as being invisible to targets and act in an
        indetectable manner as they can be installed to look like another type of app or file such as a
        digital photo application.
      </p>
      <p>The question that comes to mind here is how do these designs even get approved or put into a place
        that consumers can use them if they are this dangerous? Well these apps are usually targeted towards
        parents monitoring their children and bosses monitoring their employees.
      </p>
      <p>One such app was called StealthGenie and they were shut down for violating a federal law that prohibits the manufacturing, sale, or
        possession of any device whose primary purpose is the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or
        electronic communications. After it was shut down several copycats were created in its wake, as they
        continued to grow in their spying capabilities to include more invasive designs such as monitoring
        youtube videos, and conversations on any app that the target can chat on along with the ability to
        see locations that the victim has been, is currently and set a specific location as notification worthy
        so they know when the target is in a specific spot immediately. They can also see who the top 5 callers
        are on the phone, the top 5 call durations of those calls, top 10 frequently visited sites, and a call
        time activity punch card which shows all of the calls and their durations for every hour of the day. They
        can even record and listen to phone calls and record and listen to phone surroundings. But the most mind
        boggling thing that these new apps can do is actually control the phone/tablet remotely by locking
        it, shutting it down, wiping device data, viewing and blocking apps, being able to screenshot live,
        monitor kind of situation that could be to the abuser’s benefit.
      </p>
      <p>These apps can now be used on computers instead of just phones with all the same functionality. The dark uses of these apps are apparent and even if no
        one ever used these apps to do anything but spy on their children there is still a question of whether
        it is morally excusable or reprehensible.
      </p><p>
        Because technology has been growing so fast, not a lot of laws have been created around the needs of
        people being impacted by these design capabilities. Police officers, case workers, designers, and
        many other people are scrambling to make up for lost time by trying to piece together legislation or
        other solutions in order to protect victims affected negatively but for all of the people already
        suffering it will do little to take away their pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fault of these issues is for everyone to share, designers never should have let these products through, people who came up with the ideas should have thought
        about how they could be used negatively, more time should have been taken in the creation process in
        order to put up warnings and safety features instead of rushing through it for money. Now that these
        apps are out there in the world it is the responsibility of everyone to keep information going
        around about how technology can hurt as much as help while still pushing for the people who create these
        apps to take accountability and make their design safer or just take them down.
      </p>
      <p>Technology is an amazing creation that helps keep countless people connected and live easier lives but for those who are
        abused through it, it ruins lives, futures, and dreams while feeding the darkest kinds of abusers and their
        appetites. Design without ethics is irresponsible and damaging to everyone who comes in contact with
        it and it is the responsibility of all to keep it and the people abusing it in check.
