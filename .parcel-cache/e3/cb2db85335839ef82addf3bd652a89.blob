        <h3>Krystal Oliver</h3>
        <p>My first love has always been creative expression, it at first presented itself through drawing and
          writing and through the years and schooling I have picked up painting, photography, graphic design, and
          ceramics all of which I enjoy combining together. I would like to grow as a creative mind and use the experiences
          Iâ€™ve had over the years to experiment with different ideas of expression.
        </p>
        <p>I first became interested in computer science in college. I enjoy the logic and structure of
          programming as well as the psychology behind HCI (human computer interaction) and decided to further my studies in
          it. I was accepted on a scholarship to the Grace Hopper Celebration in 2018, a celebration of women in
          computer science, where I learned more about front end development and how I could combine my love and
          experience in art with my fascination with computer science and programming.</p>
