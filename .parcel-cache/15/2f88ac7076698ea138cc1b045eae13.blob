            <h3>Krystal Oliver</h3>
            <p>My first love has always been creative expression, it at first presented itself through drawing and
                writing
                and through the years and schooling I have picked up painting, photography, graphic design, and
                ceramics all
                of which I enjoy combining together. I would like to grow as a creative mind and use the experiences
                Iâ€™ve
                had over the years to experiment with different ideas of expression.
            </p>
            <p>I first became interested in computer science in college. I enjoy the logic and structure of
                programming as
                well as the psychology behind HCI (human computer interaction) and decided to further my studies in
                it. I
                was accepted on a scholarship to the Grace Hopper Celebration in 2018, a celebration of women in
                computer
                science, where I learned more about front end development and how I could combine my love and
                experience in
                art with my fascination with computer science and programming.</p>
