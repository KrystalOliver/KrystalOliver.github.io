                <p class="has-dropcap">There are many different techniques that designers use in order to help their
                    designs become more interesting and unique. The goal of a good design is to guide the user’s eye
                    through it in a meaningful way so they can see the most important information without the user even
                    knowing that anything was happening. A couple of the most impactful tools that will help reach that
                    goal without too much hassle are grids and the golden ratio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grid’s are a basic enough concept but the amount of impact they can make on a design is powerful.
                    They create a basic structure and framework and they can easily give consistency and interest to any
                    design without much extra work. Grids are made up of a few important pieces:
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Unit- </b>the basic building blocks of every grid. Multiple units form the overall grid and
                    they are
                    represented with the purple blocks on the image to the left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2. Gutter- </b>space in between the units that separate them. They are represented by the yellow
                    in the
                    image to the left.
