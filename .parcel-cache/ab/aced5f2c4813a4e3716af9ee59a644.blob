            <p class="has-dropcap">The internet has become a vital part of everyday life, and plenty of people share
                everything online or advertise their products or services with multiple web-based platforms. Because of
                the ease of use of the internet and the wealth of knowledge that is stored on there, a lot of people can
                start to build their own websites, blogs, or platforms for their needs.
            </p>
            <p>Originally there were only a few specialized people who really knew how to build things for the web and
                because of that there came a huge insurgence of sites that would build things for you, such as Wix and
                Squarespace. They build a whole site or page for you without you knowing anything at all about coding or
                how the internet works, all for a fee. Along with the added fees of the sites you also had a limited
                flexibility of how your content was presented but over the years it has become easier for the every-day
                person to understand how to code and build things from scratch.</p>
            <p>It is now more than possible that someone could watch a few youtube videos on HTML and CSS and get
                started on building their own sites, spending less money and having full flexibility. The problem is
                that a lot of people get overwhelmed by the amount of tags and elements that HTML has and they get
                discouraged from trying to code. They are not scary, though! They have even gotten easier to read and
                format over the years, so here is a collection of different tags and their uses and definitions to help
                you get started.</p>
            <p>The Metadata elements are usually at the start of a file, it helps set up a page or site, most of these
                will be needed for all coding projects.</p>
